CHANGES TO BE MADE:
1. Add timer/score to screen
2. Change health to a health bar rather than a number
3. Make top logs require to be crouched under
4. shorten bottom logs so player jump can be quicker
5. make the game reset when you lose
6. add sound effects
7. wood breaking animation
8. player run animation
9. player hit animation
10. Crouch animation
11. proper score system(objects that give points when the player collides with them?)
12. Try to change hit boxes to per-pixel collision rather then squares(round character leads to unfair hitboxes)
13. Convert or copy the game in the Android Monogame Framework
